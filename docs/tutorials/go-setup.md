## Prerequisites
Before starting this tutorial make sure you have the following:

1. A Github Account: Create one for free [here](https://github.com/).
2. Git Installed: You can install it [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
3. Visual Studio Code (VS Code): Download and install it from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
4. Docker Installed: Install Docker from [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

## Part 1: Setting Up Project Repository
### Create a Local Directory and Initialize Git

1) Open terminal or command prompt

2) Navigate to a folder you would like your project to be held in and create your directory:

```sh
mkdir HelloWorldGo
```

3) Enter the folder:

```sh
cd HelloWorldGo
```

4) Initialize a new git repository:

```sh
git init
```

5) Create a README file:

```sh
echo "# My new Go Project" > README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Initial commit with README"
```

### Create a Remote Repository on GitHub

1) Login to your GitHub account and navigate to the [Create a repository page](https://github.com/new)

2) Fill in any following details:

- **Repository name:** HelloWorldGo

- **Description:** "Starting a Go Project to print 'Hello World' out"

- **Visibility:** Public

3) Do not initialize the repository with a README, .gitignore, or license

4) Click **Create Repository**

### Link your Local Repository to GitHub

1) Add GitHub repository as a remote:

```sh
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/HelloWorldGo.git
```

Replace ```<your-username>``` with your GitHub username.

2) Ensure your branch's name is main and push to the remote repository

```sh
git branch -M main
git push --set-upstream origin main
```

## Part 2: Setting Up Dev Container

1) In VS Code open your HelloWorldGo folder

2) Install the **Dev Containers** extension for VS Code

3) Create a ```.devcontainer``` directory in the root of your project and add a file into the folder called ```devcontainer.json```

4) Inside the ```devcontainer.json``` file add the follwing code to setup our environment:

```sh
{
  "name": "Hello World Go",
  "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/go:latest",
  "customizations": {
    "vscode": {
      "settings": {},
      "extensions": ["golang.Go"]
    }
  },
}
```

???+ info "Extension"
    The ```golang.Go``` extension was developed by Google engineers and provides extensive language support for the Go language in Visual Studio Code. It was released in 2015.

5) Reopen the project in a container by pressing ++ctrl+shift+p++ or ++cmd+shift+p++ and then selecting **Dev Containers: Reopen in Container**

## Part 3: Creating the Go Project

1) In the terminal, confirm Go is installed using ```go version```

2) To create a Go Module use the command:

```sh
go mod init HelloWorld
```

???+ note "Purpose of ```go mod```"
    This command manages modules in Go projects which allows for the management of dependencies in Go projects. It also tracks version of dependencies used and ensures a consistent development environment. It is similar to a ```requirements.txt``` in Python.


3) Create a file ```hello.go``` and paste the following code

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

???+ note "```main``` package and import statement"
    The ```main``` package indicates that this file is the main file. It will be run by default when ```go run . ``` is run.
    The ```"fmt"``` package provides functions for formatted input and output operations. It serves the same purpose as ```<stdio.h>``` in C.


4) In the terminal you can then run your code using:

```sh
go run .
```

You should see ``Hello, World!`` output to your console 

5) Optionally you can first build an executable file using:

```sh
go build hello.go
```

6) Then you can run the executable in terminal using: ```./hello```

???+ warning
    If you wish to preserve the binary of the built program, **do not** use ```go run .```, instead use the above two step process.
